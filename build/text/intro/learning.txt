Learn Python Interactive Tutorial
---------------------------------

Learnpython.org is an easy non-intimidating way to get introduced to
python. The website takes the same approach used on the popular Try
Ruby website, it has an interactive python interpreter built into the
site that allows you to go through the lessons without having to
install Python locally.

If you want a more traditional book, *Python For You and Me* is an
excellent resource for learning all aspects of the language.

Crash into Python
-----------------

Also known as *Python for Programmers with 3 Hours*, this guide gives
experienced developers from other languages a crash course on Python.

Dive Into Python 3
------------------

Dive Into Python 3 is a good book for those ready to jump in to Python
3. It's a good read if you are moving from Python 2 to 3 or if you
already have some experience programming in another language.

Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
----------------------------------------------------

Think Python attempts to give an introduction to basic concepts in
computer science through the use of the python language. The focus was
to create a book with plenty of exercises, minimal jargon and a
section in each chapter devoted to the subject of debugging.

While exploring the various features available in the python language
the author weaves in various design patterns and best practices.

The book also includes several case studies which have the reader
explore the topics discussed in the book in greater detail by applying
those topics to real-world examples. Case studies include assignments
in GUI and Markov Analysis.

Python Koans
------------

Python Koans is a port of Edgecase's Ruby Koans.  It uses a test-
driven approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an
interactive tutorial teaching basic python concepts.  By fixing
assertion statements that fail in a test script, this provides
sequential steps to learning python.

For those used to languages and figuring out puzzles on their own,
this can be a fun, attractive option. For those new to python and
programming, having an additional resource or reference will be
helpful.

Advanced
========


Pro Python
----------

This book is for intermediate to advanced Python programmers who are
looking to understand how and why Python works the way it does and how
they can take their code to the next level.


Expert Python Programming
-------------------------

Expert Python Programming deals with best practices in programming
Python and is focused on the more advanced crowd.

It starts with topics like decorators (with caching, proxy, and
context manager case-studies), method resolution order, using super()
and meta-programming, and general **PEP 8** best practices.

It has a detailed, multi-chapter case study on writing and releasing a
package and eventually an application, including a chapter on using
zc.buildout.  Later chapters detail best practices with writing
documentation, test-driven development, version control, and
optimization/profiling.
