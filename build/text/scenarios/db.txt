Databases
*********


DB-API
======

The Python Database API (DB-API) defines a standard interface for
Python database access modules. It's documented in **PEP 249**. Nearly
all Python database modules such as *sqlite3*, *psycopg* and *mysql-
python* conform to this interface.

Tutorials that explain how to work with modules that conform to this
interface can be found here and here.


SQLAlchemy
==========

SQLAlchemy is a commonly used database toolkit. Unlike many database
libraries it not only provides an ORM layer but also a generalized API
for writing database-agnostic code without SQL.

   pip install sqlalchemy


Django ORM
==========

The Django ORM is the interface used by Django to provide database
access.

It's based on the idea of models, an abstraction that makes it easier
to manipulate data in Python.
